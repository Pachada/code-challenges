What is the Sliding Window Technique?
The sliding window technique is an algorithmic paradigm that involves creating a 
"window" of fixed size and sliding it over the data structure (usually an array or string) 
to find a particular substructure, such as a substring or subarray that satisfies certain conditions. 
This technique is useful for solving problems that involve contiguous sequences with specific properties.

The window size can either be fixed or variable depending on the problem. 
You generally start with the window at the leftmost side and move it toward the rightmost side, 
updating the solution and the window's limits as you go.

Key Elements
Window Start & End: Two pointers to represent the start and end of the window.
Window Size: The size of the window, which can be fixed or variable.
Conditions: Criteria that the elements within the window must satisfy.
Advantages
Efficiency: Often reduces the time complexity to O(N).
Simplicity: Easier to implement and understand.
